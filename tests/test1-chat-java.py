"""
Automated testing
Assignment: Chat
Test 1 for Java code

Tests included:
Does the server start? If not, perhaps the name is wrong?
Does the client start? If not, perhaps the name is wrong?
Are messages transferred immediately?
Does the client end when stdin ends?
Does the client write the correct output?
